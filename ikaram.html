                <p>The fieldwork for this grammar was carried out in Ikaram, a town of around 5000
                    inhabitants. Along with the seven of the other Abesabesi-speaking settlements,
                    it is located at 7°36'38.2896''N, 5°51'49.0752''E in the Akoko North West Local
                    Government Area (LGA), the northernmost LGA of Ondo State in Nigeria. It
                    stretches along a road that connects Owo in Ondo State with Kabba in Kogi State,
                    which can be used to drive between Lagos and Abuja. </p>

                <p>As other parts of the Akoko area, Ikaram is surrounded by hills, forest and farm
                    land. <a class="intext-button" href="bibliography.html?entry=d1e1133">Boyd (2009,
                        p. 47)</a> classifies the area as "derived guinea savanna" with a rainy
                    season from March/April to October/November. The economy is characterized by
                    farming and virtually everyone cultivates farmland. Some for a living and others
                    for their own subsistence. Cash crops are yam and cassava (mainly in the form of
                        <i>gari</i>, the fermented and roasted cassava flour) and corn. Crops that
                    are mainly used for self-subsistence are melons, guinea corn, tomatoes, pepper,
                    beans and various leafy vegetables. Livestock include goats, sheep, turkeys and
                    chickens that are held within the village. Cattle is held by Fulani tribes
                    outside the village. Ikaram has two markets that take turns and operate every
                    five days. </p>
                <p>Ikaram has a relatively well-developed infrastructure. It is situated on a main
                    road connecting major cities, has daily public transport to regional centers, a
                    health center, several primary and secondary schools and access to the national
                    electricity grid. However, infrastructure problems that are common to the whole
                    nation, such as continual power failures, poor conditions of streets and the
                    lack of safety on roads due to armed robbers and kidnapping, also affect Ikaram. </p>
                <p>The town is composed of five quarters: Ayeteju, Itabalogun, Iyoke, Iyotu and
                    Oyagi. Two of those quarters have a different name in the Ekiromi dialect of
                    Abesabesi: Ayeteju is called <span class="jl-txt">ɔ̀ʃùgù</span> and Itabalogun
                    is called <span class="jl-txt">ìtùjò</span>. 
                    <a class="intext-button" href="bibliography.html?entry=d1e558">Agoyi (2013, p. 72)</a> mentions
                    that each of these quarters used to be independent with their own king until
                    1885, when the Akala Akombo Momodu of Iyotu joined them together and started to
                    rule over the whole of Ikaram. <span class="jl-txt">Akala</span> is the title given to the king of
                    Ikaram. <a class="intext-button" href="bibliography.html?entry=d1e6">Abimboye (2008, p. 7-9)</a>, however claims the founding father of
                    Iyotu already arrived with a crown and thus ruled over the whole of Ikaram. He
                    presents a line of succession starting with the son of the founding father and
                    ending with the ruling king at date of publication. It includes 12 kings. The
                    last king has died and is followed by the presently ruling king, the Akala
                    Andrew Momodu. </p>
                <p>In terms of confessions, the people of Ikaram are Muslim or belong to one of the
                    various Christian denominations that are popular in Nigeria. While Islam reached
                    the Akoko area through the Nupe invasion, Christianity entered the Nigeria's
                    Southwest through European missionaries and expanded through Yoruba missionaries
                    to the Akoko. I had no access to figures, but I am estimating that about a half
                    of the population is Muslim and the other half Christian. Both religions are
                    rather common in the Yoruba dominated area of Nigeria. There are elements of the
                    traditional belief, which is still practiced today but usually only in addition
                    to the Christian or Muslim confession. This traditional belief bases on the
                    Yoruba religion and incorporates local deities and customs. The local deity of
                    Ikaram is called <span class="jl-txt">òtòlòm</span> and attributed to a pond within the town area. It is
                    worshiped at a dedicated shrine, where a chief priest is in charge of
                    ceremonies.</p>
                <p>Customs specific to the place are a local masquerade called <span class="jl-txt">abug</span> and a
                    festival <span class="jl-txt">abog</span>. The festival was dedicated for mature girls to get married
                    but is not practiced anymore. Dances associated to the festival, however, are
                    still performed at the New Yam festival (<span class="jl-txt">imùnaǹ</span> in Ekiromi). </p>
