                <p>This digital reference grammar is part of my PhD project "A Digital Reference Grammar of
                    Abesabesi" and therefore deserves the same acknowledgments as given in the thesis:
                    It has not only been the result of many hours of work, but also of
                    generous amounts of help and advice by multiple people I would like to thank. </p>
                <p> I am most grateful for the people of Ikaram, who welcomed and accomodated me in
                    their town, taught me about their language and culture, answered my questions
                    and took care of me. I thank H.R.M Andrew Momodu, the Akala of Ikaram, for
                    accepting me at the palace and providing me with a temporary home, for a lot of
                    advice and for presenting me to the people of Ikaram. I thank Dr. Taiwo Agoyi
                    for being my first anchor in the Akoko hills, for inspiring my research, for
                    presenting me to all the great researchers and students at Adekunle Ajasin
                    University in Akungba, for bringing me to Ikaram and for all the moral support
                    during my field trips. I thank Olori Adenike and Olori Ilile for taking such
                    good care of me, providing me with ever delicious meals and making the palace
                    feel like home. I thank Arohunmolase Haruna for taking care of my security,
                    showing me all the nice places of Ikaram and climbing the hills with me. I thank
                    Steven Ayodele Awolami, Chief Abiodun Afolabi, Chief Alice Elegbeleye, the
                    Eleperi Chief Olaniran Samuel Jimo for the never ending wealth of stories you
                    could tell me, for all the songs and proverbs you taught me and for all the help
                    you provided for my research. Thank you Laisi Rafiu for translating stories and
                    narratives for me, for being patient with me and for putting up with all of my
                    questions. I also thank Mama Joy for providing me with biscuits, snacks and
                    anything else I needed, and for teaching me bits of your language. And I am
                    grateful for all the other speakers that told me stories, translated sentences
                    and helped me with my questions. Their names are Janet Akeju, Bashiru Naibi

                <p>I also want to thank everybody that supported me at the University of Cologne.
                    First of all, my first supervisor Birgit Hellwig, who was always there when I
                    needed feedback, support, or any advice from funding over academic writing to
                    fieldwork methods. Thanks for all your efforts and enthusiasm, I could not have
                    imagined a better supervisor! Many thanks also to my second supervisor Andreas
                    Witt, who directed me on my path through the digital humanities and gave
                    valuable advice and feedback on the development of this grammar and its data
                    format, and on my thesis. Additional thanks go to my third supervisor Nikolaus
                    Himmelmann, and my former office mates Felix Rau and Luiz Antonio de Sousa
                    Netto. Thank you for inspiring thoughts, a comfortable working atmosphere and
                    all your feedback. Lena Wolberg has helped me out in numerous situations:
                    organizing my finances, ordering my equipment, and so many more. Thank you for
                    your support, your efficiency, your organizing skills, and all the nice
                    conversations! </p>

                <p> For all support regarding TEI, thanks to Toma Tasovac and Laurent Romary, who
                    taught at the Lexical Data Masterclass and who haved continued giving me
                    feedback and advice on my data format. For technical support, I would like to
                    thank the Data Center for the Humanities (DCH) and the Cologne Center for
                    eHumanities (CCeH) - especially Patrick Helling, Sviatoslav Drach, and Jonathan
                    Blumtritt. Thank you for helping me set up and host the application and for
                    providing me with support for existDB. I am also very grateful for the financial
                    support I received to make this research possible. I was granted a PhD
                    scholarship from the a.r.t.e.s. Graduate School for the Humanities Cologne and
                    benefited from their support and infrastructure. I have received valuable
                    feedback and inspiration from my graduate class supervised by Martin Becker and
                    Nicolas Pethes. The fieldwork would not have been possible without the funding
                    of the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme (ELDP) who awarded me a
                    small grant. I am grateful for your support and the opportunity to deposit my
                    research data in the Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR). A very special thank
                    you goes to Sophie Salffner, who was my first signpost to Ikaram. I am truely
                    grateful for suggesting to work on Abesabesi, for getting me in contact with
                    Taiwo, for providing lots of inspiration through your archive deposits and
                    research and for all your feedback and support. I would not have gotten to know
                    Ikaram without you!</p>

                <p> A big thank you goes to my dear friend Sarah Dopierala, who made all my
                    sentences beautiful and gave me tons of feedback, inspiration and support
                    throughout my PhD. And finally, I would like to thank my family and friends who
                gave me strength and supported me during this PhD project.</p>
