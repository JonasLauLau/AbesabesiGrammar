                <p>This electronic grammar, along with my thesis "An electronic reference grammar of
                    Abesabesi" has been the result not only of many hours of work, but also of
                    generous amounts of help and advice by multiple people I would like to thank. </p>
                <p> I am most grateful for the people of Ikaram, who welcomed and accomodated me in
                    their town, taught me about their language and culture, answered my questions
                    and took care of me. I thank H.R.M Andrew Momodu, the Akala of Ikaram, for
                    accepting me at the palace and providing me with a temporary home, for a lot of
                    advice and for presenting me to the people of Ikaram. I thank Dr. Taiwo Agoyi
                    for being my first anchor in the Akoko hills, for inspiring my research, for

                showing me all the nice places of Ikaram. I also thank Mama Joy for providing me with
